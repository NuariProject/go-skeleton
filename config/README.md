## `config` Folder

This folder contains application configuration files such as `.env`, `.json`, and `.yaml`. Centralizing environment variables and settings here makes it easy to configure the application for different environments (development, staging, production).

### Example Structure

```
config/
├── app.env
├── config.yaml
└── config.json
```
