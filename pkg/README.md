## `pkg` Folder

This folder contains independent and reusable functions/packages that do not depend on the internal application logic.
They are dynamic, general-purpose, and portable, so they can be used across multiple projects.

### Example Structure

```
pkg/
├── hash/
│   └── hash.go
├── logger/
│   └── logger.go
├── validator/
│   └── validator.go
```
